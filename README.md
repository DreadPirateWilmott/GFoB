Rogue Dwarves
=============

Rogue Dwarves is a game about controlling a group of dwarves through things like enemy invasions, outbreaks of disease, and flooding (among other things). I plan to continue development of this game for the forseeable future. I love to work on this game and I hope you love to play it. If you want to read about how to play the game, all important information can be found on the subreddit /r/rogue_dwarves.
