TextOpenAI
==========

Testing AI systems in a text based game coded by me, written in python.
The first few version released onto github will be barebones, no AI programs, but in around a week I plan on releasing the
final version before the AI will begin being developed.

Please note that I am new to python, and programming in general, I am young and prone to mistakes which I hope you will forgive.

Part of this project is to see how many consecutive days I can contribute to the project with my goal being one month.
