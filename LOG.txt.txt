-Multiple commits including new LOG file and most of the code for movement. Movement still needs turning support but it
-well underway. The games autogenerated text files have now been added to the repo, though they are not necessary.The plan
-for tomorrow is transferring things over to a server that manages the turns of the player and AI. Also for tomorrow I 
-would like to add turning functionality to the program tomorrow.
