November 13th 2013
-Worked on setting up the repository aswell as the readme file. No code was written or committed to the project.
November 14th 2013
-Multiple commits including new LOG file and most of the code for movement. Movement still needs turning support but it
-well underway. The games autogenerated text files have now been added to the repo, though they are not necessary.The plan
-for tomorrow is transferring things over to a server that manages the turns of the player and AI. Also for tomorrow I 
-would like to add turning functionality to the program tomorrow.
November 15th 2013
-Added turning functionality, this took well over 3 hours but is a substantial change to the functionality of the game.
November 16th 2013
-Slow day, only added the variable block placing distance and updated the REAME file.
November 17th 2013
-Added the ability to dig up blocks up to four blocks away, this is done to directly oppose the placing ability. Now you
-are able to place and dig blocks. This contributes to the ability to build fortresses and to infiltrate them in interesting
-ways.
November 18th 2013
-Fixing bugs, and making slight changes to make the program easier to use. Wiki is on the way.
November 19th 2013
-Added the ability to shoot, Wiki will be worked on tomorrow
November 20th 2013
-Added a warning system when you are around blocks, it will tell you when you are close to other blocks so you don't
-waste a turn.
November 26th 2013
-Since I've last input into this log the project name has been changed into Goblins: Fortress of Blood. I think that it 
-is a much more interesting title to the game. I also added a main menu and the ability to choose your characters name.
November 27th 2013
-Huge idea day! Today I added the ability to place a block that lets you set the parameters for the size of your fortress.
-In this area you will be safe from being killed by roaming / raiding parties of dwarves. Tomorrow will be a huge leap forward
-in terms of mining. Inventory systems will be going up in the near futured as well as the ability to mine, smelt, and use
-ores / resources.
November 28th 2013
-I added more layers to the world to start building on mining. I also began adding a system for saving the game, and I 
-also finally figured out how the inventory system will work.
November 29th 2013
-I added the ability to move multiple blocks to the movement system. It didn't take that long but fixing bugs took a little
-while. I also started a GFoB subreddit so the WIKI will be hosted there. If you have any bug reports then please message
-my reddit account. That is going to be the best way to contact me. Also feel free to come to the subreddit and air any
-criticsms you have of my game, just be warned that if you say it is the lack of visuals you won't get much of a response.
November 29th 2013
-I added a fully fledged mining system with two resources, coal and iron. Tomorrow I will be adding either a building
-system or finished off the save system.
December 1st 2013
-I added some command shorthand so that you can get commands happening quicker
December 4th 2013
-Updates will be happening faster now that I have more time to work on this project. Today I integrated the inventory 
-with the mining and placing abilities. I also changed the game so that it calls spaces tiles instead of blocks. Tomorrow
-I will be working on the view function. This function will check the top Y layer and output an ASCII image of the landscape.
