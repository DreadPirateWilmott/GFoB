-Worked on setting up the repository aswell as the readme file. No code was written or committed to the project.
November 14th 2013
-Multiple commits including new LOG file and most of the code for movement. Movement still needs turning support but it
-well underway. The games autogenerated text files have now been added to the repo, though they are not necessary.The plan
-for tomorrow is transferring things over to a server that manages the turns of the player and AI. Also for tomorrow I 
-would like to add turning functionality to the program tomorrow.
November 15th 2013
-Added turning functionality, this took well over 3 hours but is a substantial change to the functionality of the game.
November 16th 2013
-Slow day, only added the variable block placing distance and updated the REAME file.
November 17th 2013
-Added the ability to dig up blocks up to four blocks away, this is done to directly oppose the placing ability. Now you
-are able to place and dig blocks. This contributes to the ability to build fortresses and to infiltrate them in interesting
-ways.
